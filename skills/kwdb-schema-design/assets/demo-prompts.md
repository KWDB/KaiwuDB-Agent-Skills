# Demo Prompts

Example prompts for testing kwdb-schema-design skill.

## Schema Design (CREATE TABLE)

### Time-Series Examples

#### 1. Basic Sensor Data
```
Design a KWDB schema for temperature sensors that report every minute.
```

#### 2. IoT with Multiple Metrics
```
I need to store data from IoT devices that send temperature, humidity, and pressure readings.
```

#### 3. With Retention Requirements
```
Create a schema for storing machine sensor data for 90 days only.
```

#### 4. Complex Sensor Setup
```
Design KWDB tables for a fleet of electric vehicle chargers. Each charger reports voltage, current, power, and status every 30 seconds. Data should be kept for 1 year.
```

### Relational Examples

#### 5. E-commerce Entities
```
Write KWDB DDL for customers, products, orders, and order_items tables.
```

#### 6. User Management
```
Design a schema for a user management system with roles and permissions.
```

#### 7. Inventory System
```
Create schema for product inventory with categories and warehouse locations.
```

#### 8. With Foreign Keys
```
Design a KWDB schema for a blog system with users, posts, comments, and tags.
```

### Mixed Workload Examples

#### 9. Sensor + Device Info
```
I have temperature sensors. Each sensor has metadata (location, model, install_date) and sends readings every minute.
```

#### 10. User Activity Tracking
```
Track user logins and actions over time. I need to store user info and their activity history.
```

### Disambiguation Examples

#### 11. Ambiguous Request
```
How should I model product pricing history?
```

#### 12. Unclear Workload
```
I want to store application logs with different severity levels.
```

### Edge Case Examples

#### 13. Minimal Info
```
Design a KWDB table for storing sensor data.
```

#### 14. With Constraints
```
Create a schema for orders where total_amount must be positive and status can only be 'pending', 'shipped', or 'delivered'.
```

#### 15. JSON Data
```
Design a schema for storing user preferences as JSON.
```

#### 16. Partitioning Request
```
Create a partitioned table for monthly sales data.
```

## Index Operations

#### 17. Add Index to Relational Table
```
Add indexes to the orders table for frequently queried columns: customer_id, status, and created_at.
```

#### 18. Composite Index
```
Create an index on orders table for queries that filter by customer_id and status together.
```

#### 19. Tag Index on Time-Series
```
Add a tag index to sensor_readings table for queries that filter by sensor_type.
```

#### 20. Covering Index
```
Create an index on products table that includes columns for common SELECT queries (category, price).
```

## ALTER TABLE Operations

#### 21. Add Column
```
Add a phone column to the customers table.
```

#### 22. Add Column with Default
```
Add a status column to orders with default value 'pending'.
```

#### 23. Modify Column
```
Alter the users table to change the name column from VARCHAR(50) to VARCHAR(100).
```

#### 24. Rename Column
```
Rename the 'created' column to 'created_at' in the orders table.
```

#### 25. Add Check Constraint
```
Add a constraint to products table to ensure price is greater than 0.
```

#### 26. Set Retention on Time-Series
```
Alter the sensor_data table to set retention to 30 days.
```

## DROP Operations

#### 27. Drop Table
```
Drop the old_logs table from the database.
```

#### 28. Drop Index
```
Drop the idx_customer_status index from the orders table.
```

## View Operations

#### 29. Create View
```
Create a view for active orders that shows order details with customer name.
```

#### 30. Create Materialized View
```
Create a materialized view for monthly sales summary.
```

## Schema Review

#### 31. Review Existing Schema
```
Review this schema and suggest improvements:
CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name VARCHAR(100), email VARCHAR(254));
CREATE TABLE orders (id INT, user_id INT, amount DECIMAL(10,2));
```

#### 32. Add Missing Constraints
```
The orders table needs proper primary key and foreign key constraints. Design the ALTER statements.
```
